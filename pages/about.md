# About Me

Having spent 17 years working as a performance manager in public libraries, I'm currently studying Data Analytics with Imperial College Business School.  

Having spent many years telling stories with data using long-established tools like Excel and Access, I am relishing the new skills I'm learning during my 2024 study sabbatical: python, SQL and github.  On this site I will be linking to some of the coding projects I've been working on, which include:

* [a Kaggle project to analysise Olympic curling results](https://www.kaggle.com/code/helenwhitehead/curling-at-the-beijing-olympics-2022-eda)
* [a codeacademy project to identify patterns in threatened species](https://github.com/hwhitehead355/biodiversity_parks)
* [a Kaggle project to predict survival on the Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/code/helenwhitehead/titanic-prediction-competition)

I live in York, UK, and outside work I'm keen on fitness, gardening and Morris Dancing.
